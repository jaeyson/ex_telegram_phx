# ExTelegramPhx

**TODO: This library is being parked at version 0.1.0. This is just an empty Phoenix boilerplate. You'll see some changes once this version starts at v0.3.0**

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
